  Lots of folks have given talks and presentations on Thorntail over the last year or so.
  Not all of the talks have been recorded, but there is plenty of good reading material
  in the slide decks alone. Check them out on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/thorntail/presentations">thorntail/presentations</a>.
