== Thorntail 2.7.0.Final

On this day in 2003, the Spirit rover launched from Cape Canaveral, heading over to Mars.
To celebrate that memorable event, we bring you ... wait for it ... a new Thorntail release!

=== What's New?

* MicroProfile 3.3 support
** Completely new Fault Tolerance implementation
** Different treatment of empty values in Config
* Keycloak 9 rebase
* Component updates

== MicroProfile 3.3 support

Thorntail now implements MicroProfile 3.3 by including the latest https://www.smallrye.io/[SmallRye] artifacts.
These specifications have been updated to a new version:

* Config 1.4
* Fault Tolerance 2.1
* Health 2.2
* Metrics 2.3
* RestClient 1.4

Smaller updates have also been done to implementations of other MicroProfile specifications.

=== Completely new Fault Tolerance implementation

*WARNING: Breaking changes!*

We updated from SmallRye Fault Tolerance 2.x to latest version 4.3.0.
This is a complete reimplementation of the MicroProfile Fault Tolerance specification, which is no longer based on Hystrix.
An important consequence is that the Hystrix configuration is no longer necessary, and it is ignored.

You can learn more about SmallRye Fault Tolerance 4.x on the SmallRye blog:

* https://smallrye.io/blog/fault-tolerance-4-0/[4.0 announcement]
* https://smallrye.io/blog/fault-tolerance-4-1/[4.1 announcement]
* https://smallrye.io/blog/fault-tolerance-4-2-and-4-3/[4.2 and 4.3 announcement]

It brings one interesting experimental feature on top of the MicroProfile Fault Tolerance specification: the ability to observe circuit breaker state changes.
You can learn more about this feature in the 4.3 announcement, linked above.

=== Different treatment of empty values in Config

*WARNING: Breaking changes!*

SmallRye Config treats empty values differently than before.
The empty values treatment is now more consistent, and the change should become specified in MicroProfile Config in an upcoming version.

== Keycloak 9 rebase

Thorntail 2.6.0.Final used Keycloak 8.0.1.
In 2.7.0.Final, we updated to Keycloak 9.0.3.
Note that this Keycloak version no longer supports Drools-based policies.

== Component updates

Thorntail 2.7.0.Final is still based on WildFly 18.0.1, but we updated a few components to newer versions.
Specifically:

* RESTEasy 3.11.2
* Undertow 2.1.3
* Jackson 2.10.3

We have also updated a bunch of other components that do not come from WildFly.
Most notably:

* Jaeger client 0.34.1, together with Apache Thrift 0.13.0
* OpenShift Java RestClient library 9.0.0.Final, to better support latest OpenShift versions
* SnakeYAML 1.26
* ShrinkWrap Resolver 2.2.7, to always use HTTPS when talking to Maven Central

== Other notable changes

*WARNING: Breaking changes!*

The JAX-RS fraction no longer provides the JAXB API transitively.
This was a mistake, and for using JAXB with JAX-RS, you had to use the `jaxrs-jaxb` fraction anyway.
Hence, the impact should be very small, even though this is technically a breaking change.

When an environment variable or system property that corresponds to a Thorntail configuration property is set to `+<<null>>+`, the corresponding configuration value is now set to `null`.
This wasn't possible before; setting an environment variable or system property to an empty string always leads to setting the corresponding configuration value to an empty string as well.
In some cases, this makes a big difference.

We have added the ability to filter `WEB-INF/lib` only in the uberjar with `<filterWebInfLib>uberjar-only</filterWebInfLib>`.
With this option, the WAR file inside the uberjar is repackaged, but the WAR artifact itself is left unchanged.
This is useful when the WAR artifact is used on its own, e.g. deployed to WildFly.

The MVC fraction now uses the latest stable API and implementation of the MVC specification.
The fraction is also marked as stable now.

We have also done some improvements to better support running on IBM JDKs or OpenJ9.
