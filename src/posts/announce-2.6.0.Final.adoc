== Thorntail 2.6.0.Final

A little early for the end-of-year festivities, but we still present you the best present we can: a new Thorntail release!

=== What's New?

* MicroProfile 3.2 support
* WildFly 18 rebase
** Red Hat Maven repository requirement
* Keycloak 8 rebase

== MicroProfile 3.2 support

Thorntail now implements MicroProfile 3.2 by including the latest https://www.smallrye.io/[SmallRye] artifacts.
These specifications have been updated to a new version:

* Health Check 2.1
* Metrics 2.2.1

Smaller updates have also been done to implementations of other MicroProfile specifications.

== WildFly 18 rebase

Thorntail has been based on WildFly 15.0.1.Final since version 2.3.0.Final.
With 2.6.0.Final, Thorntail is now based on WildFly 18.0.1.Final, bringing along a lot of improvements and bugfixes.

This means that we switched from the Java EE 8 spec artifacts to Jakarta EE 8 spec artifacts.
For most of the Jakarta EE specifications, we still use the JBoss spec artifacts, just like WildFly.
These JBoss spec artifacts have been aligned with Jakarta EE as well.
Jakarta EE 8 spec artifacts are binary compatible with Java EE 8 spec artifacts, so no change to applications should be necessary.

=== Red Hat Maven repository requirement

*WARNING: Breaking changes!*

The https://maven.repository.redhat.com/[Red Hat Maven repository] has been added to the set of default Maven repositories Thorntail uses to download artifacts.
This is because WildFly now uses some artifacts from that repository; see https://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/wildfly-dev/2019-August/006949.html for more details.

If you use a Maven repository proxy, such as Nexus, don't forget to add https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/ to the list of proxied repositories. 

== Keycloak 8 rebase

Thorntail has been using Keycloak 4.8.3.Final since version 2.4.0.Final.
With 2.6.0.Final, Thorntail now uses Keycloak 8.0.1, which is also based on WildFly 18.0.1.Final.

== Other notable changes

One new fraction is present in this release: `hibernate`.
This fraction is basically an equivalent of the `jpa` fraction, but it also transitively brings in the correct versions of Hibernate artifacts.
If you need to use Hibernate-specific APIs, using this fraction is preferrable to managing Hibernate versions manually.

We have contributed to the http://dekorate.io/[Dekorate] and http://halkyon.io/[Halkyon] projects so that they support Thorntail better.
If you use Kubernetes or OpenShift, be sure to check them out!

The `swagger` fraction now also generates `swagger.yaml`, in addition to `swagger.json`.
Note that the `swagger` fraction is quite out of date; MicroProfile OpenAPI is most likely a better choice.

The `scanner` fraction can now be configured in `project-defaults.yml`.
Previously, you had to resort to `standalone.xml` if you wanted to use the `scanner` fraction.
Note that we specifically _don't_ recommend using `scanner`, because it only exposes the underlying WildFly subsystem and isn't aware of anything that Thorntail does to the deployment.
